- [taichi-2d-vof](https://github.com/houkensjtu/taichi-2d-vof/) implements the 2D Volume of Fluid (VOF) method for simulating two-phase fluid dynamics using Taichi. The VOF method is popular in computational fluid dynamics for tracking the interface between two immiscible fluids, such as air and water. The core VOF advection function is based on Murray Rudman's modified version of Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) algorithm. The main simulation loop repeatedly performs velocity advection, applies external forces, enforces incompressibility, updates the velocity field, advects the volume fraction field, and visualizes the results. This concise code demonstrates the power of the Taichi language for efficient fluid simulations on GPUs.

- Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is very popular and famous in the fields of optimization algorithms and evolutionary algorithms. The process of the DE depends on a large loop even with 1,000,000 iterations. However, because pure Python/Matlab have difficulty in a large loop and compiling a C++ program is rocket science, it is significant that using Taichi to accelerate pure Python program and reducing the difficulty of coding simultaneously. This project implements a DE algorithm based on Taichi and provides 2D/3D visualization.
