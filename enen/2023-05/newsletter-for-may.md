  - [MagneticMPM](https://github.com/joshDavy1/magneticMPM) is a simulator built with Taichi programming language to model the dynamic behavior of magnetic soft robots. It provides an easy-to-use solution for accurately simulating the complexities arising from the relationship between material elasticity and external magnetic fields

  - This is a [1D Landau damping simulation](https://github.com/HuntFeng/landau-damping-pic) based on the PIC (Particle-in-Cell) method implemented using Taichi. The simulation code, consisting of just around 300 lines, is capable of parallel computation on GPUs.
